== Water chestnuts invasive species ==
The lake has had a problem of being overrun with water chestnuts (water caltrops), an invasive species which crowds out native species. The plant, which evolved in Europe and Asia, is destructive to the native plants, fish, and birds. Volunteer groups have been organized to pull out the invasive weeds to help control the growth.
In addition to the water chestnuts, in the summer, a large portion of the lake becomes covered in lily pads, which can add challenge and opportunity for fishing.
