The Third Millennium Bible (TMB), also known as the New Authorized Version, is a 1998 minor update of the King James Version of the Bible.  Unlike the New King James Version, it does not alter the language significantly from the 1611 version, retaining Jacobean grammar (including "thees" and "thous"), but it does attempt to replace some of the vocabulary which no longer would make sense to a modern reader.


== Characteristics ==


=== Canon ===
The TMB, like the original KJV in 1611, contains the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament in between the Old and New Testaments. This has helped win it some support among traditionalist Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox Christians. A version without the Apocrypha (and with formatting changes) is known as the 21st Century King James Version.
