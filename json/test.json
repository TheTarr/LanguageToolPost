{"text": "MORE THAN KIP FIT!\n\nDo you know mountain biking? Perhaps you think it\u00b4s only a sport. You\u00b4re wrong. Follow reading to know why!.\n\nI\u00b4m keen on mountain biking since three years ago. Firstly, I tried with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar. The main reason why I wanted to prove was to lose weight (I was a bit overweight). However, it was wonderful how I could admire the landscape while I was doing sport.  Consequently, I realized that although ciclyng outside helped me to improve my fitness, really I enjoyed the best breathing pure air and taking pleasure the countryside.\n\nIf someone wants to take up this sport, first of all, I would recommended him or her to pursue a good mountain bike. It\u00b4s important to avoid accidents, become comfortable and have a good journey. Secondly, he or she would buy a good helmet and, of course, appropriate clothing. \n\nI love this sport. I look forward to the weakened, to go out with my bike and my group of friends. All of us spend a good time. And I would like to encourage everybody to prove.

I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film especially when it is a thriller than doing sport, \n\nIf you want to see a good thriller, \"Regression\" will be your best option. I have seen it recently and in my opinion, it should be seen by everyone because I believe people would like it for many reasons. First of all, the director, who was Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar, did a great job due to that, the spectators were waiting with bated breath as the final of this film will be. Secondly, the actors were fantastic and the main character, which was performed by Emma Watson (who is really hilarious), was amazing. What's more, the plot is easy in order to understand. The history took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by the doctors and cientifics. Moreover, customs, make-up and special effects became ever more in reality the story. However, the soundtrack was awful, it didn't get having a scared.\n\nIn conclusion, my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thiller must be seen if you had spent a good time given than it achieves keeping in suspense until the end and it doesn't be afraid.

The ticket doesnt cost to mutch and it is avaible for the majority of the people at least comparing to buying a car.\n\n      Secondly, public transports are more eficent to travel for long distance than cars and people wouldnt have to purchase combustible. When people are avaible to tavel to other continents or far away, they may need a plane, wicth is a public transport, to complete the journey because the have tu cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms.\n\n      However, a car is something witch is from the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same way he or she left it, and sometimes public sports arent left in the best way. In addiion, you have to share with people you absolutely dont know and probably wont see again. Consequesntly yo can be stole or get sick. But, by obseving all these people you can rich yourself with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporate new topics.\n\n       To conclude we can establish a middle point. Public sports are useful but sometimes inconvenient but more cheaper.

{"text": "          Generally speaking, it has been suggested that mixed-sex education will improve to the degree of learning system at schools. In another way of saying, this kind of education system should be included in the whole classes in all schools. However, I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in the classes, but also it is related to the quality of education level in the schools.\n          Education has a crucial part in one society and it\u2019s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Nowadays, unfortunately, students cannot take enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries. Their systems are no longer that good enough and students will not make a good career for their future.\n         On the other hand, by building more effective learning system which will provided by local authority, students will encouraged them learn more efficient. Lack of teaching way, poor audience of the class, quantity of learning materials, for instance, all of these matters should be enhanced until the good quality has been set up in the system. Besides, by putting these kinds of procedures, students will  also gain more respect towards career and their job.

The reasons for this as follows.\nLearn how to walk before learn how to run, the opponents contend the children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue. Confronting with challenges, primary students are struggled on the difference between first language and the learning one. Thus, people view that children learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later.\nNonetheless, I would contend that learning foreign at primary school brings countless benefits to children. Primary school, the best moment for learning, children are easier and faster to gain knowledge. Not only less study burden when compare by secondary school, but they are able communicating with foreigners as well as extend their societal network during that period and the later life. Rather than concern about the challenges, children would confront with, it is particularly advantaged for them to grasp foreign language during the elementary school.\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outweigh than the drawbacks.

I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment.\nI used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. Where I live now I noticed that have the opportunity to recycling the waste because it is a posh area. In my opinion I think the government should take care of all area, even is a poor or rich area. The pollution has a negative contribution to the environment .I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban area. Birds from urban area is difficult for them to find a proper food instead. Some people from area which I live they used to feed the birds but others they don't even care. To keep all the nature alive we must contribute everyone of us for future generation.

But the present we live it, we live the moment and benefit from it at the maximum. If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. As far as I am concerned. I do believe that people's lives in the future will change toward the bad. No because I am pessimist but due to several factors and condition allow me to divulgue my opinion.\n\nFirstly, we are living in unstable world. It is true that every day we have new innovation which help people and make their life more easier. But from life's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life. Human are looking for a power and they are applying forest law, The stongest beat the weakest. To illustrate. There are a categorisation of countries, there are developed countries, emerged one and on the way of development countries. Who classified those countries like this? whare the critria of this ranking? and...\nThese questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for convenient answer. Hence, The above indicates details support the idea that there will be a change in people's lives but in negative side.\n\nIn addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. And unfortunately this bad impact exist almost in all lives filed. For example. Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and improve from diseases but have another hidden effect. This effect always leaves people suffering later after the usage. Therefore, The afformentioned information above show that our future can be worse than our present.\n \nTo summarize, People's life knows a fast change and development, but generally this evolution affecting people.
