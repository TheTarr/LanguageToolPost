The Battle of Sabilla (29 March 1929) was the main battle of the Ikhwan Revolt in northern Arabia between the rebellious Ikhwan forces and the army of Abdulaziz Al Saud. It is the last tribal uprising in Saudi Arabia. It was also the last major battle in which one side rode camels, as the Ikhwan emphasized radical conservatism and shunned technological modernization. 
The rebellious, but technologically mediocre, Ikhwan were decisively defeated by the Saudi forces, which included machine-guns and cavalry. The battle occurred in Sabilla, located twenty miles east of Al Zulfi. The Saudi forces were also supported by the British Royal Air Force which bombed the Ikhwan forces near Jordan and Kuwait.Faisal al-Dawish, one of the three leaders of the rebellious Ikhwan tribes, was wounded in the battle. According to Ibn Saud Information Resource, his injury was "serious". Another leader, Sultan bin Bajad, allegedly fled the battle scene. There are also reports stating that both Ikhwan leaders were arrested, but not executed. They remained in jail until the end of their life. Of them Sultan died in 1932 in prison.In the eyes of Ibn Saud's supporters, the battle was necessary for the ability to continue Saudi conquest of the peninsula. The Ikhwan regarded it as a massacre and a betrayal. Abdulaziz Al Saud, a pious Muslim but also a forward-thinking pragmatist, began to modernize his new empire. This infuriated the Ikhwan, who saw it as a betrayal. Then the Ikhwan began to attack neighboring British-held territory, which they hoped to "liberate." Abdulaziz Al Saud had forbidden this, wishing to remain friendly with the powerful British Empire. The al-Saud clan and Ikhwan fell into open warfare, which ended when Al Saud used modern machine guns to defeat the camel-riding Ikhwan at the 1929 Battle of Sabilla.
