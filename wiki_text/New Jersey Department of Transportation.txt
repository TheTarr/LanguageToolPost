The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) is the agency responsible for transportation issues and policy in New Jersey, such as maintaining and operating the State's highway and public road system, planning and developing transportation policy and assisting with rail, freight and intermodal transportation issues. It is headed by the Commissioner of Transportation. The present Commissioner is Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti.


== History ==
The agency that became NJDOT began as the New Jersey State Highway Department (NJSHD) circa 1920. NJDOT was established in 1966 as the first State transportation agency in the United States. The Transportation Act of 1966 (Chapter 301, Public Laws, 1966) established the NJDOT on December 12, 1966.

In 1979, with the establishment of New Jersey Transit, NJDOT's rail division (which funded and supported State-sponsored passenger rail service) was folded into the new agency.
Until 2003, the NJDOT included the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which was reorganized as the self-operating New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC).
Since the late 1970s, NJDOT has been phasing out or modifying many traffic circles in New Jersey.
