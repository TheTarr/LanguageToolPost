Stephen Mitchell (born 1943 in Brooklyn, New York) is a poet, translator, scholar, and anthologist. He is married to Byron Katie, founder of The Work.


== Education ==
Stephen Mitchell was born to a Jewish family, educated at Amherst College, the University of Paris, and Yale University, and "de-educated" through intensive Zen practice. He studied for four and a half years with Zen Master Seung Sahn and for two and a half years with Robert Aitken, Rōshi.


== Career ==
Mitchell’s translations and adaptions include the Tao Te Ching, which has sold over  million copies, Gilgamesh, The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Gospel According to Jesus, Bhagavad Gita, The Book of Job, The Second Book of the Tao, and The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. He twice won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets. His Selected Rilke has been called “the most beautiful group of poetic translations [the twentieth] century has produced” (Chicago Tribune), his Gilgamesh was runner-up for the first annual Quill award for poetry, and his Iliad was one of the New Yorker’s Favorite Books of 2011. He is also coauthor of three of his wife's bestselling books: Loving What Is, A Thousand Names for Joy, and A Mind at Home with Itself. His latest book, Joseph and the Way of Forgiveness, is a Zen-inflected midrash on the Joseph story from the Book of Genesis. The First Christmas is a reimagining of the Nativity story.
