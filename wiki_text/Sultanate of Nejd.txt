The Sultanate of Nejd (Arabic: سلطنة نجد, Salṭanat Najd) was the third iteration of the Third Saudi State, from 1921 to 1926. It was a monarchy led by the House of Saud. This version of the Third Saudi State was created when Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, Emir of Riyadh, declared himself sultan over Nejd and its dependencies. In December 1925, the Kingdom of Hejaz surrendered to the forces of Abdulaziz, who was thereafter proclaimed king of Hejaz in January 1926 and merged his dominions into the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd.
